2. Microsoft Stories
Full disclosure: We've totally gushed over Microsoft's "Stories" microsite before. We can't help it — what better way to revitalize an old-school brand than with a blog that boasts beautiful, interactive, and inspiring branded content? Plus, the square layout of these stories is reminiscent of the Microsoft logo, which achieves a valuable brand consistency.

Microsoft Stories is also a prime example of how a business blog can be a major asset for an overall rebrand. In recent years, Microsoft has worked to humanize its brand, largely in response to a rivalry with Apple. The "Stories" microsite has a simple tagline — "Get an inside look at the people, places and ideas that move us." It's the softer side of Microsoft, so to speak.

When you're trying to convey a certain brand message, your blog can be used to communicate it — both aesthetically, and content-wise.
